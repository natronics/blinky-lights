# blinky-lights

My first 555 project, also an example board for [psu-epl](http://psu-epl.github.com/).

It's a small PCB with a [555 timer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC)
that drives the clock of a shift register/LED driver IC to make a bunch of
LEDs blink in a turn.

CAD files are made with the free version of [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/).
